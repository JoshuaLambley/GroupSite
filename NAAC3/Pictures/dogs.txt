Bio: Bella is a sassy and needy animal, she has been at NAAC for 4 months now but is actively searching for her fur-ever home. She sleeps in the bed with you and she will eat and go outside on her schedule. She is house trained but still chooses to do her business inside when she thinks you've neglected her. Dispite her issues, she is very smart and can do 2 tricks: sit and dance. Bella is very food motivated and needs to be an only dog in her new home.

Lily

Bio: Lily is one of our more high maintenance dogs at NAAC. She likes baths and bows but will not walk on grass or gravel. She aspires to be a show dog but unfortunately cannot walk in a straight line and is always overlooked. She will melt your heart with her 5am "singing" when she whines to tell you she is ready to start the day!
